I'm not the first to notice Google search results getting worse and worse. I'm not the only one to try alternatives without luck. I can't be the only one who feels like the garage door of the internet is slowly closing and if we don't all decide to roll under it now, we're going to get cut off from the wider web.

I wanted to host a dedicated site to start this blog, but I ran into two problems:
First, Blogs are drowned out by Articles in search, so why complicate things when all I'm doing is screaming into the void?
Second, Blogs are drowned out by Articles in search, so all I get are fake reviews for awful web hosting services, even when appending "reddit" to my search terms, so I can't even find a decent host without a lot of wading.

A static site on Github is more than enough, I'm sitting next to so much open source that it almost eases the claustrophobia I get from a web search.

Here are some of the topics I want to cover sometime soon:
- Horny Earth Theory
- Web GL
- History and Definition of Real Occult Magic
- Neural Networks and Sleeper Codes
- Inside-Out Inner Teachings
- Game Development Cycles
- Words and Counter-Words
- 2000 Year Old Dream Fish
- Wrestling Opposites
- Black Thumb Gardening
- Framework Swapping
- Alibi
- Alchemy's Transition to Chemistry
- D
- Modern Electric Necromancy

This has been your Uncle Dimmi. 
I love you.
Good luck, and good bye.
