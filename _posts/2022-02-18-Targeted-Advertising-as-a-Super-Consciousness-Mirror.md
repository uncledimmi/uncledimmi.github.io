So you're talking to a family member about getting a new microwave oven when, BAM, without even looking at your Google Search bar, all the ads on Facebook are suddenly trying to sell you a microwave. What, how did..?

Should you be paranoid your phone is secretly recording you? I mean, it wouldn't surprise me, but that's not the main driving force behind this effect. Eerie predictions of what you're vaulnerable to buy are heavily informed by the actions of several someones who aren't you. You almost certainly would've gotten those ads irrespective of your verbal conversation about wanting a new microwave. 

Maybe your microwave killed the power to your apartment a week ago and you searched for information on your powerbox. Maybe you've been eating more fast food than usual, or you didn't purchase microwaveable popcorn before streaming movies all weekend, or you googled "what temperature to reheat pizza in oven". Tale as old as time. Bob who lives 50kms from you searched up his powerbox 6 months ago, stopped looking at the microwave meal blog he'd previously hit up twice a week, and then clicked an ad for a new microwave after searching "how to make mac and cheese without a microwave".

Deep learning algorithums can pick up on the similarities between you and Bob and everyone else who've clicked on microwave ads. I heard a story several years ago, I'm not sure if it's true but it's not unlikely, of a girl who was sent a physical Target catelogue for baby clothes and toys before she even realized she was pregnant. Several people I know claim to have recieved targeted ads for things they have only even thought about in their heads. Advertisers are hoarding vast swaths of data on each an every one of us, comparing that data, and using it to optimize clicks... and inadvertinly revealing a layer of reality that was previously hidden from us.

__Super Conciousness__

A lot of people will refer to this as collective conciousness, and imply it has something to do with psychic powers, something something _conciousness grid_. I can't speak to that, I haven't been able to find much quality information on the topic. I can however 


This has been your Uncle Dimmi. 
I love you.
Good luck, and good bye.
